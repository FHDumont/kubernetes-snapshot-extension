## Use Case

The extension monitors events and the state of Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters, records attributes of resources: pods, endpoints, daemon sets, replica sets, deployments and nodes.
The data is received via Kubernetes API at a configurable interval and is sent to the AppDynamics Analytics Events API. Metrics are automatically created
and stored under a desired Application Tier. Metrics can be viewed in the Metrics Browser under Application -> Metric Browser -> Application Infrastructure Performance
-> Tier Name -> Custom Metrics -> Cluster Stats.

![Sample Dashboard](https://github.com/sashaPM/kubernetes-snapshot-extension/blob/master/metrics.png)
The extension aggregates metrics at the cluster level with further categorization by node and namespace.

If you want to monitor events only, use [Kubernetes Events Extension](https://github.com/Appdynamics/kubernetes-events-extension).
If you are interested in automated metric collection for events and other cluster resources, this extensions is self-sufficient. The event collection is enabled by default.

The extension automatically creates the dashboard below. The first attempt to create the dashboard is made
after the number of seconds defined in the *dashboardCheckInterval* setting has passed since the first run of the extension.

![The Default Dashboard](https://github.com/sashaPM/kubernetes-snapshot-extension/blob/master/dashboard.png)

Other specialized dashboards with the metrics collected can be built in AppDynamics -> Dashboards & Reports.

For each exposed metric, a named ADQL query is created by the extension along with the dashboard. Double-clicking on a dashboard widget will open the corresponding query.
These automatically created queries can also be accessed under Analytics -> Searches. The search names are built in the following format:
```
<Cluster Name. Metric Name>
```


## Prerequisites

 * This extension requires the Java Machine Agent.
 * The AppDynamics platform needs the Events Service set up.
 * REST API credentials. The account can be created under Administration -> Users. The user account must have rights to create dashboards and saved searches.
 * You will need one or more Transaction Analytics/APM Peak licenses to consume the raw data. Viewing metrics and the dashboard does not require PEAK licenses.
 * The number of collected metrics depends on the size of the cluster in terms of namespaces/projects and nodes.
 It may be necessary to increase the threshold for metric ingestion in the machine agent configuration:
 ```
 -Dappdynamics.agent.maxMetrics=2000
 ```
 The current metric collection rate is:
   * Cluster-specific: 52
   * Node-specific: 15
   * Namespace-specific: 39

 By default, the extension will collect the cluster-level metrics only. To monitor specific nodes or namespaces add the names of the desired nodes or namespaces
 to the `node` and `namespace` arrays of the config.yml respectively. See specific instruction below in the *Optional settings* section.
 If you request metric collection for some or all nodes or namespaces, make sure to adjust the maxMetric parameter accordingly.

## Installation

Either [Download the Extension from the latest Github release](https://github.com/Appdynamics/kubernetes-snapshot-extension/releases/download/0.87/KubernetesSnapshotExtension-0.87.zip) or Build from Source.

1. Deploy the `KubernetesSnapshotExtension-<VERSION>.zip` file into the `<machine agent home>/monitors` directory.

  `> unzip KubernetesSnapshotExtension-<VERSION>.zip -d <machine agent home>/monitors/`

2. Set up `config.yml`.

**Required settings**

  ```
    # Prefix for metrics. Replace <appTierName> with the value in appTierName setting.
    metricPrefix: "Server|Component:<appTierName>|Custom Metrics|Cluster Stats|"


    # Path to your kubectl client configuration. A typical location is "$HOME/.kube/config",
    # but it may differ on your machine. Can be left blank, if apiMode is set to "cluster"
    kubeClientConfig:

    # Name of the application. It can be an existing application or a new application.
    # All collected metrics will be associated with it
    # The extension will first look for APPLICATION_NAME environmental variable.
    # The application name in the machine agent configuration must match this value
    appName: ""

    # Name of the tier where metrics will be stored. The tier will be associated
    # with the application configured earlier
    # The extension will first look for TIER_NAME environmental variable.
    # The tier name in the machine agent configuration must match this value.
    appTierName: ""

    # Events API Key obtained from AppDynamics --> Analytics --> Configuration API Keys --> Add
    # The API Key you create needs to be able to Manage and Publish Custom Analytics Events

## Contributing

Always feel free to fork and contribute any changes directly via [GitHub](https://github.com/sashaPM/kubernetes-snapshot-extension).

## Troubleshooting

1. Verify Machine Agent Data: Please start the Machine Agent without the extension and make sure that it reports data. Verify that the machine agent status is UP and it is reporting Hardware Metrics.
2. config.yml: Validate the file [here](http://www.yamllint.com/)
3. Check Logs: There could be some obvious errors in the machine agent logs. Please take a look.
4. `The config cannot be null` error.
   This usually happens when on a windows machine in monitor.xml you give config.yaml file path with linux file path separator */*. Use Windows file path separator *\* e.g. *monitors\Monitor\config.yaml*. For Windows, please specify
   the complete path
5. Collect Debug Logs: Edit the file, *<MachineAgent>/conf/logging/log4j.xml* and update the level of the appender *com.appdynamics* and *com.singularity* to debug. Let it run for 5-10 minutes and attach the logs to a support ticket.
